Tagging process
================================================================================

Tagging data is generally entered by DCC or study phenotype expert users. After tagged variables are created, a 3-step review process is completed:

1. DCC team member reviews the tagged variable and confirms or flags for further review
2. For flagged tagged variables, a study phenotype expert reviews and either agrees to remove it or provides an explanation for why it should not be removed
3. For those the study experts provided explanations for, a DCC user reviews it again and makes a final decision of whether to remove it or keep it

Tagged variables removed during the review process are archived, and not completely deleted.
