                        <li>Apply the tag to study variables from all time points and all repeated measures within each time point.</li>
                        <li>Apply the tag to both corrected & uncorrected, adjusted & unadjusted study variables.</li>
                        <li>Apply the tag to all instances of duplicated study variables. </li>

                    </ul>
                <li>Unless otherwise noted in tag instructions, a study variable should usually only have one tag
                    applied to it.</li>
                <li>Some study variables (composites) are calculated or inferred from a combination of other variables (i.e.
                    components).</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unless otherwise noted in tag instructions, do not apply a phenotype tag to component
                            study variables that could be used to derive the phenotype.</li>
                        <li>e.g. height and weight are component variables used to derive the body mass index (BMI). Do not
                            apply the "BMI" tag to height or weight variables or vice versa.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Do not tag medication variables with their related phenotype tag; instead, there is a general
                    "medication use" concept with which all medication use variables should be tagged.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>e.g. A study variable for lipid-lowering medication use should be tagged as "medication use"
                        and not as "LDL in blood" or "HDL in blood", etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Disease/event/intervention/behavior phenotype tags:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Status concepts include prevalent and incident diseases (e.g.asthma, COPD), events
                            (e.g. MI), medical interventions (e.g. angioplasty, CABG), and behavior (e.g. smoking).
                            Status variables are qualitative indicators of whether individuals have the specified
                            disease, event, intervention, or behavior. Status may be based on self report, adjudication,
                            clinical verification, medical records, ICD code, or by calculation/inference from related
                            traits. Tag both prevalent and incident case variables.  Include both event status and
                            time-to-event variables for incident cases. Include variables that give age at 
                            diagnosis/event/intervention/behavior (e.g. answer to question "how old were you when you
                            first were diagnosed with asthma").</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Multiple tags for the same study variable:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In general, the phenotype concepts are defined with enough specificity to avoid multiple
                            tagging of a single study variable.  However, there will be exceptions.  A clear exception is
                            when a single study variable represents multiple distinct phenotypes.  For example, consider a
                            data set containing blood chemistry results for a number of subjects. This data set has
                            multiple rows per subject with columns named subjectID, analyte (blood analyte type such as
                            LDL, fibrinogen, IL6), and concentration (measurement of concentration of the corresponding
                            analyte).  For rows in which the analyte column value is "LDL", the concentration column is
                            a measure of LDL concentration; for rows in which the analyte column value is "fibrinogen",
                            the concentration column is a measure of fibrinogen concentation; etc.  In this example,
                            both the analyte and concentration variables should be tagged with all three phenotype
                            concepts ("LDL in blood", "Fibrinogen in blood", and "Interleukin 6 in blood").</li>

                    <li>These types of variables usually provide age for multiple different phenotypes. For example,
                        age at blood draw corresponds to age at measurement of all blood chemistry analytes assayed from
                        that blood draw; age at clinic visit for imaging provides age for all traits derived from the
                        images, etc.  These types of age variables should be tagged with the
                        "Age at enrollment/collection" tag.</li>

                    <li>These types of variables are tagged with the corresponding event/diagnosis/behavioral concept.
                        For example, age at onset of asthma symptoms should be tagged with "Asthma status", age at onset
                        of smoking should be tagged with "Cigarette smoking", time to event where the event is COPD
                        should be tagged with "COPD".</li>
