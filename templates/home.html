        <p> <strong>PIE</strong> allows TOPMed investigators to view and search through the phenotype data
            currently available to the TOPMed Data Coordinating Center. The DCC is in the process
            of combining study phenotypes across TOPMed projects to produce harmonized
            phenotypes. TOPMed Working Groups can help the harmonization process by submitting
            details for how to combine study phenotypes.

                Phenotype data from each study is downloaded from dbGaP and stored securely at the TOPMed DCC.
                Metadata (but not phenotype data values) are scanned and stored by PIE to facilitate browsing,
                searching, and tagging phenotypic variables and datasets. dbGaP accession numbers uniquely identify each
                study, dataset, and variable. These study variables are used as the source material for the DCC's
                reproducible and rigorously documented phenotype harmonization process.

            <h2>Harmonized phenotypes</h2>
            <p>
                The TOPMed DCC is producing a high quality, lasting resource of publicly available and thoroughly documented
                harmonized phenotype variables. The DCC works with Working Group members and study and
                phenotype experts to define a target harmonized variable and idenfity the component study variables to
                use. Harmonized variables are listed on PIE as they become available. Once finalized, datasets
                containing harmonized variables can be downloaded from the dbGaP TOPMed exchange area by authorized
                TOPMed investigators (<a href="https://www.nhlbiwgs.org/dcc-harmonized-phenotypes">more information here</a>).
                Eventually these harmonized phenotypes will be available from dbGaP.
